what topic of this course you enjoyed the most
For me this course while enjoyable I felt it could have been more. Regardless of that I would say my favorite/most intersting unit was the Git/Gitbash/powershell unit(s) as they are coding languages I am now learning more indepth for my CIRCUIT intership which has me doing data analysis with Python, SQL and NoSQL databases, GitLab, Unix. The skills that I appreciate the most are the ability to navigate in and out of directories as well as our practice with GIT Repositories both online and offline.  -->
